Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is concerned with how computers deal with human language. We are already interacting with such machines in our day-to-day life in the form of IVRs & chat-bots. But do Machines really understand human language, context, syntax, semantics, etc.? Yes, they can be trained to do so!
Google has trained its search engine to make autofill recommendations as text is typed using NLP. Google’s search engine has the capability of understanding the meaning of words depending on the context in the search. Google’s “state-of-the-art” search engine is one of the most sophisticated examples of NLP.
Origination of Natural Language Processing dates back to the II world war when there was a need for machine translation between Russian & English. Today, NLP has expanded beyond these two languages and can deal with most languages, including sign language.
NLP is actively used for a variety of day-to-day activities like spam detection, recruitment, smart assistants, understanding customer behaviour & so on...... Usage and impact of NLP are growing exponentially, across a wide range of industries.
Acronym NLP is used for both Natural Language Processing & Neuro-Linguistic Programming, but, these are completely different fields of science. Neuro-Linguistic Programming deals with human-to-human interaction, whereas Natural Language Processing deals with human-to-computer interaction.
